# Studio Konkon Play

Site address: https://play.studiokonkon.com/

This site is for all things random and personal. You could say it's just my hobby site. I may have things like game and music blogs, test apps or a language course. Who knows!

The main reason for this repository is to help with reporting issues and get support related to out website. However, keep in mind that I am not always able to answer all questions or provide updates to everything. Reports should only be used about the software and any technical issues related to our site, not the content posted or about any 3rd party code out of our control.
