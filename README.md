# Studio Konkon Play

Site address: https://play.studiokonkon.com/

This site is for all things random and personal. You could say it's just my hobby site. I may have things like game and music blogs, test apps or a language course. Who knows!

The main reason for this repository is to help with reporting issues and get support related to out website. However, keep in mind that I am not always able to answer all questions or provide updates to everything. Reports should only be used about the software and any technical issues related to our site, not the content posted or about any 3rd party code out of our control.

## Dark Mode Support

Bootstrap already supports "Dark Mode" which can be activated, however, any changes and custom components I create is not fully tested for use in "Dark Mode" and may not support it either.

I'm sorry but I won't be planning any testing or support for dark mode. It's not that I hate it but simply that dark mode causes eye strain and it's difficult for me to work with. It only takes up to 3 seconds and I get an instant migraine, blurred vision and feeling sick.

Light mode has never been an issue and even in the dark, light mode does not burn my eyes as others claim happens to them (maybe they have their brightness set at 100% or at least above 40%). I've already seen a doctor and optician and they say it's simply the shape of the eye, how light enters and how the brain processes that light; There's nothing I can do about it except wear darkened glasses that darkens white text on black. Kind of pointless, really.

Unfortunately, dark mode is impossible for me to work with and neither do I need it. While some dark mode may get implemented as part of theming with other colours, this is only a personal project but anyone is welcome to share their "Dark Mode" code.
